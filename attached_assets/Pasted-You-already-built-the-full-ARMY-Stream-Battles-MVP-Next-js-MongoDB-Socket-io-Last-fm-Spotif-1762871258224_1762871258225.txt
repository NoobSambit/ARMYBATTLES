You already built the full ARMY Stream Battles MVP (Next.js + MongoDB + Socket.io + Last.fm + Spotify). 
Do NOT change backend logic or database. 
Now upgrade the frontend UI to a modern, responsive design.

✅ BEFORE CODING:
- Read README and scan the existing project
- Understand current pages and components
- Keep all routes and APIs intact

✅ NEW FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS

1. Add Tailwind CSS to the project (clean, lightweight)
- Configure Tailwind properly
- Remove plain HTML styles and rebuild UI with modern components

2. Global Layout + Navbar
- Create a global layout wrapper used by all pages (except login/signup)
- Navbar (sticky top, responsive):
  * Logo / site name: ARMY Stream Battles
  * Home
  * Battles
  * Host Battle
  * If not logged in: Login / Signup buttons
  * If logged in: Profile dropdown with Logout
- Mobile menu should collapse into hamburger icon

3. NEW Landing Page ("/")
- Full-screen hero section with purple gradient background
- Headline: “Join BTS Streaming Battles”
- Subtext: “Compete with ARMY worldwide. Real verified streams, real winners.”
- Two CTA buttons:
    * Host a Battle
    * Join a Battle
- Show cards for:
    - Active battles
    - Upcoming battles
- Each battle card styled with:
    * name
    * status badge (active/upcoming)
    * start/end time
    * join button

4. Login / Signup UI Revamp
- Centered card UI with soft shadows, rounded corners
- Stylish inputs, clean buttons
- Add "Continue" button with loading state

5. Battle Page UI
- Show battle details inside a styled card:
    * Battle name
    * Playlist
    * Start/end time
- Real-time leaderboard as a styled table:
    * Rank
    * Username
    * Verified streams
    * Cheat flag icon if detected
- Add animated “Live Updating…” indicator

6. Battles Listing Page ("/battles")
- Grid or list of all battles
- Tabs or filters:
    * Active
    * Upcoming
    * Ended
- Beautiful card layout with purple glow or soft neon theme

7. Host Battle / Join Battle Modals
- Instead of a plain form, use a modal or centered card
- Styled buttons, hover effects, transitions

8. RESPONSIVE DESIGN (MOBILE FRIENDLY)
- Navbar collapses to hamburger
- Cards stack vertically
- Leaderboard scrolls horizontal on small screens

9. DESIGN GUIDELINES
- Aesthetic: BTS / ARMY inspired
- Purple gradient backgrounds
- Rounded corners
- Soft shadows
- Glow effects on buttons or headers
- Modern fonts
- Avoid heavy libraries, keep UI optimized

10. DO NOT:
- Do not modify existing backend logic
- Do not change Socket.io implementation
- Do not remove MongoDB
- Do not rewrite pages from scratch — enhance them

11. AFTER IMPLEMENTATION:
- Update README with new UI screenshots
- Ensure routing still works
- Ensure login redirects correctly when user is logged in
- Test homepage, battles page, battle detail, profile dropdown, logout
